# password-strength-checker
This repository contains my first project on Github: A password strength checker project coded in python.

## Description and why I chose this project
A secure password or passphrase is the main control protecting the vast majority of our online accounts from unauthorised access. A strong password is important because it acts like a sturdy lock protecting our information in the digital world. Even though many organisations are adopting passwordless authentication methods, passwords are still quite common so we need to ensure they cannot be easily guessed or brute-force cracked.

## Installation
